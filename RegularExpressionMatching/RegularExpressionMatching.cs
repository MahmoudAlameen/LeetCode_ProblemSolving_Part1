     steps of solution:-
     1- create method for creating RegAutomaticEngine
     2- create method  that take RegAutomaticEngine and string 
                return true if string matched false other wise
     RegAutomaticEngine has state and arrows
    each arrow belong to state and directed to specefic state 
    there is base states : -
     start state 
     finite state 
    string should take path from start state and arrive to finite state to be acepted as matched 
    other wise will be considered as not matched
